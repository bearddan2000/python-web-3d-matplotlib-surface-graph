# python-web-3d-matplotlib-surface-graph

## Description
A demo of creating a 3d surface graph.

A Surface Plot is a representation of three-dimensional dataset. It describes a functional relationship between two independent variables X and Z and a designated dependent variable Y, rather than showing the individual data points. It is a companion plot of the contour plot. It is similar to the wireframe plot, but each face of the wireframe is a filled polygon. This helps to create the topology of the surface which is being visualized.
